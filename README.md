# CorneliusRaynor
This website is all about me. My name is Cornelius Claudius Cromwell Raynor. 

Welcome! =)

This website is for me to use to practice coding and for personal journalling. The journalling will be based primarily around my recovery and self-care (hopefully it makes for interesting reading)... I will update this website as and when I can and will continue to update it aestetically, as well as continuing to develop content for it too.

These three pages will form the basic website:

1. Homepage - introduction to the site (Homepage)
2. CV and profile. (Profile)
3. My 12 step journey. (Miracles)

In sequential, mroe advanced versions of the site, additional pages (or subpages) will begin to exist which include (but are not limited to): a gratitude journal, a miracles journal, a stoic calender, projects (links to web projects - download links for desktop projects), my story, blog posts, a picture gallery, music (downloadable)...

This website will have only one contributor and will be my pet project until the time in which I see it fit to discontinue the creation of content for it.

This is my first repository.

=)
