This is a website all about me. Welcome! =)

I will use this website for coding practice and for personal journalling. It will be based primarily around my recovery and self-care (hopefully it makes for interesting reading)...

At its core, the website will include a page on:
1. Homepage - introduction to the site (Homepage)
2. CV and profile. (Profile)
3. My 12 step journey. (Miracles)

In more advanced versions of the site, additional pages (or subpages) will begin to exist which include (but are not limited to): a gratitude journal, a miracles journal, a stoic calender, projects (links to web projects - download links for desktop projects), my story, blog posts...

This website will have one contributor and will be my pet project until the time in which I see it fit to discontinue the creation of content for it.
